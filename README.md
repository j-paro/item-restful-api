# item-restful-api

This code covers sections 4, 5, and 6 of the "Build professional REST APIs with Python, Flask, Flask-RESTful, and Flask-SQLAlchemy" class taught by Jose Salvatierra. The code is separated into two areas: code using SQLAlchemy and code not using SQLAlchemy. The SQLAlchemy code obviously takes an ORM approach.

The following areas are covered in one more sections of the code:
- Flask
- Flask-RESTful
- JWT Authorization
- Interaction with an SQLite Database
- User Registration
- SQLAlchemy

Section 5 uses sqlite3 only. Section 6 uses SQLAlchemy.

The Items API is essentially a CRUD API.

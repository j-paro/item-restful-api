# item-restful-api

This code covers sections 4, 5, and 6 of the "Build professional REST APIs with Python, Flask, Flask-RESTful, and Flask-SQLAlchemy" class taught by Jose Salvatierra. It used the following features:
- "Flask-RESTful" Library
- Authorization (for the GET item request only given we're in DEV)
- Interaction with an SQLite Database
- User Registration
- Constants File

This is essentially a CRUD API.
